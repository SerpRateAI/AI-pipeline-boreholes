Branching: The serpentine veins exhibit fine white branching patterns, which could provide clues about the fluid pathways during alteration. \n\n6. Slickensides: Falint slickensides are observed at 57cm, indicating movement along the fracture. \n\n7. Dunite: The rock sample is composed of serpentinized dunite, a type of ultramafic rock that typically contains olivine and pyroxene. \n\n8. Magnetite: Magnetite is present in the dunite, indicating iron enrichment during alteration. \n\n9. Gabbroic dyke: A gabbroic dyke is present at the top of the sample (5mm thick) and at 61cm (2mm thick), providing more information about the geological history of the area. \n\n10.

Sub-vertical: The text mentions the orientation of various geological features, such as serpentinized rocks and veins, being subvertical, i.e., perpendicular or steeply inclined to the ground. This is an important aspect of their geological formation and spatial distribution. \n\n2. Black serp: The term \""serp\"" refers to serpentine, a group of minerals that are formed by the alteration of other rocks, such as pyroxenite and harzburgite, under high pressure and temperature. The color black indicates the dark appearance of these rocks. \n\n3. Pyroxenite: This is a type of ultramafic rock that contains mainly pyroxene minerals. It is one of the rocks that can be altered into serpentinite. \n\n4. Green halo: This describes a green-colored area surrounding the black serp, which may indicate the presence of other minerals or chemical compounds that were formed with or after the serpentinization process. \n\n5. Serp veins: These are small, thin veins of serpentinite that cut across other rocks, such as pyroxenite, indicating a later-stage alteration process. \n\n6. Harzburgite: This is another type of ultramafic rock that is rich in olivine and pyroxene minerals. It is also prone to serpentinization. \n\n7. Gabbro vein: This is a type of intrusive igneous rock that forms as magma cools and solidifies underground. The presence of a gabbro vein within the serpentinized rocks may indicate a complex geological history of magmatism and alteration. \n\n8. Pegmatitic: This refers to the texture of a rock that contains large crystals or mineral grains, often forming veins or pockets. In the case of gabbro, pegmatitic textures may indicate a slow cooling process that allowed the minerals to grow to larger sizes. \n\n9. Fine black serp: This describes the texture and color of the serpentinite veins present in the rock samples. The fine grain size indicates a rapid cooling or alteration process. \n\n10. White plag: This refers to the presence of white-colored plagioclase feldspar minerals within the pegmatitic gabbro vein. This mineral is commonly found in igneous rocks and may indicate the origin or composition of the magma that formed the vein."",
