# **Implementation of Polytope function to determine linear connectivity of segmented images**

Here is described the process leading to the process of Polytope function for segmented images.
In order to do this, you'll have to download the 

segmentation forof Core images using the Ilastik software. 
To begin with, you will have to [download Ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org).
